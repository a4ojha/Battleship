### You will be given _5 ships_:

- Aircraft Carrier (**_5 squares_**)

- Crusier (**_3 Squares_**)

- Destroyer (**_2 Squares_**)

- 2 Boats (**_1 Square_**)

These ships will be randomly assigned a position on the 10x10 grid that is printed to the right of your screen.

In this game, you will be playing against the computer in a game of battleship:

### Key:
- □ = empty spot
- X = alive ship
- ■ = hit ship
- ◪ = misfire

You and the computer will take turns firing shots at each other's grid, without seeing each other's ship placement. With each turn, you will enter the coordinates for where you want to attack, and your opponent will shoot at a random spot on your grid.

The goal is to destroy all 5 of your opponent's ships!

Once either you or the CPU wins, both boards will be displayed to reveal possible leftover ships of your opponent. Good luck and have fun!
